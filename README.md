# Hello-Polyglot-World

Every programmer knows how to say Hello in their favorite language. Now,
can you localize that?

## Locales
Translations are located in the folder `_locale`. Languages
are named by their IETF code, each with its own text file.

For example, the file `en.txt` is for English, and contains the following text:
    Hello, world!
